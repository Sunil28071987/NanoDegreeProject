The HTML file is actually generated by the python codes. Specifically, by `python entertainment_center.py` You fill out the movie details such as name, storyline, image_url, trailer_url using the class defined in `media.py`, and call function open_movies_page() defined in `fresh_tomatores.py`. Regular expression is used to replace the key information of a html template.

The generated HTML is hosted at my AWS: <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jychstar/fresh_tomatoes.html>
