# IPND Stage 2 Final Project

# You've built a Mad-Libs game with some help from Sean.
# Now you'll work on your own game to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.

# For this project, you'll be building a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz.
# Your quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks.
# The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph.
# This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!

# Note: Your game will have to accept user input so, like the Mad Libs generator,
# you won't be able to run it using Sublime's `Build` feature.
# Instead you'll need to run the program in Terminal or IDLE.
# Refer to Work Session 5 if you need a refresher on how to do this.

# To help you get started, we've provided a sample paragraph that you can use when testing your code.
# Your game should consist of 3 or more levels, so you should add your own paragraphs as well!
# There should be 3 levels with 4 blanks each. The player will first choose a level to play, and then each time the player enter an answer for a blank. If the answer is correct, then continue to the next blank; if not, the player will be asked to enter again.

blanks  = ["___1___","___2___", "___3___", "___4___"]
sample1 = '''A ___1___ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a ___1___ takes by adding ___2___ separated by commas between the parentheses. A ___1___ by default returns ___3___ if you don't specify the value to return. ___2___ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary, tuple, and ___4___ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.'''
answer1=["function", "variables","None","list"]

sample2="___1___ intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines. In ___2___ science, an ideal intelligent machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.Colloquially, the term ___1___ is applied when a machine mimics ___3___ functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ___4___ and problem solving."
answer2=["Artificial", "computer", "cognitive","learning"]

sample3="___1___ intelligence (EI) or emotional quotient (EQ) is the capacity of individuals to ___2___ their own, and other people's emotions, to ___3___ between different feelings and ___4___ them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior. "
answer3=["Emotional","recognize","discriminate","label"]
