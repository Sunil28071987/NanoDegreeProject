This repo is used to submit my Udacity Nanodegree projects. I enjoyed doing these projects, some of the which are well-designed to get you involved. And the timely feedbacks from Udacity reviewers are very helpful.

I did most of the projects from 2016.9 to 2017.9, and was interrupted several times due to ongoing interviews. Beginning from 2017.11, I began to work full-time as a data scientist/machine learning engineer. 

In retrospect, these nanodegrees are somewhat expensive (800+1000+800+400+800+600+200 = 3600 USD). But it is worth the money that you have a chance to peek into the latest "fancy" technology.  Today I still sometimes go back here to refresh my knowledge.
